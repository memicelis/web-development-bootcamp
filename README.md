[Web_Development_Bootcamp] is a project that was given by Microverse. We had to redesign the similar project to this one, but we had to include personal content with or own data and photos. Web Development Bootcamp is about learning cutting-edge technologies and gaining hands-on experience to become a proficient developer in just a few months.
